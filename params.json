{"name":"Thoughts To Words","tagline":"","body":"## Time to start it all over again\r\nWell the experiments with the blogger seems to have gone nowhere.\r\nIt's been almost a year since i published a post in my Blogger blog.\r\nThis will be like a second experiment for me.\r\n\r\nA _**LOT**_ has changed since i blogged last.\r\nI have moved from Kochi to Bangalore with my new job (still an Android app developer).\r\nIt's sort of a step up and its been almost three months since i moved here.\r\nSo far, it has been an interesting new phase. In three months i have already been a part of a wonderful project and released from it :) (MNC life i suppose). Had a couple of trips and planning more.\r\n\r\nLived away from home for more than a month after almost 5 years.\r\nAlso this is like the first time i have lived outside of my home state of Kerala. I wouldn't say that i am home sick or anything... But i do miss the languid life of my village. \r\n\r\nI am sort of still adjusting to the City life and according to Ranjith I have still not accepted the bangalore life.\r\nAnd i think he is correct about that. Every time i purchase something, i still compare prices. And i do have to say that things are prohibitively expensive in big cities.\r\n\r\nDaily life is just flashing by nowadays. Wake up --  Get ready for office -- run for the office shuttle -- get to office in it [if lucky else own mode of travel: basically BMTC or returning cabs]-- do your job -- get back to flat -- have food -- watch some TV -- Browse the web-- go to sleep ---- Repeat.\r\n\r\nAnd i have to say Bangalore is cold. Or maybe cooler for most people but for me it is quite cold. Getting adjusted to the colder climate takes time it seems. Still getting used to it and a sore throat or running nose is a part daily life now.\r\n\r\nI am trying to break the monotony of daily life with some pet projects of mine and this is one of them.\r\n\r\nI always wanted to blog like a coder ever since i read about it in a blog long back. I am just starting with it now.\r\n\r\nKeeping my fingers crossed.\r\n\r\nPS: Seems like this rant of mine is the longest post i have written in a long time :).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
